Fuzzy logic and neural networks share the common ability to improve the decision making process for systems characterized by ill-defined dynamics and working in an imprecise environment. For fuzzy systems this is done through linguistic description of the system by combining fuzzy sets with fuzzy rules following a well-structured numerical estimation procedure. For neural networks, this is done through detecting patterns and relationships from a set of training input-output data gathered from the system, while learning from relationships and adapting to change. The course is mainly intended as introductory material for fuzzy logic and neural networks and outlines the most recent developments in these areas and their applications for intelligent systems design.

The course focuses on what is, and should be, the role of engineers in society as advocates for public welfare at the local, national, and global levels; and how one can expand their basic professional development skills to be a better advocate. This course is open only to students in their 4B term who are expected by their department to meet all of their graduation requirements with the exception of PDENG 55 by the end of the Winter 2009 term.

            "description": "When the term \"Hellenistic\" was first coined in the 19th century by J.G. Droysen, implicit in his terminology was an understanding that there was a fusion of various cultural threads that resulted in an Hellenic koine (shared culture) that spread throughout the Mediterranean from the death of Alexander the Great to the Battle of Actium (323-31 BCE).  In the years since Droysen's analysis, scholars have emphasized the \"Greekness\" of the koine, yet the Hellenistic world was one where the Greek generals who split Alexander's empire were left in charge of areas with their own long cultural heritage, such as Egypt and Persia.  In addition, Rome became involved in the Eastern Mediterranean by the 2nd century BCE, adding its cultural heritage and demands to the mix.  This multiplicity of cultures and cultural ideas shows that, while the overriding cultural ideology may have been Greek, the many threads present should be viewed rather as koinai and not a monolithic koine.  This course will examine these and other issues by looking at the various centres of Hellenistic culture (Alexandria, Antioch, Athens, Delos, Pergamon, Rome) and seeing what contributions each made to the artistic koinai of the age.  What general presumptions and assumptions have scholars made in the past?  Are certain regions responsible for specific styles or do they reflect the styles of the day?  What role does Rome play as the eventual cultural hegemon?",

The history of the Hellenistic kingdoms, in the specific context of international relations with the native peoples dominated by the Hellenistic rulers, is one of both alienation and assimilation, of bigotry and acceptance, of rebellion and (often uneasy) co-operation.  The course looks at both positive and negative aspects of that interaction between cultures that was so profoundly characteristic of the Hellenistic kingdoms, examining both culture clash and, ultimately, the benefits that  mutual intercourse may (or may not) have brought to both sides.",

For roughly three centuries, until the suicide of the Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, the Egyptians lived under an alien ruling authority of Hellenic heritage.  Furthermore, they lived and worked alongside numerous immigrants of the same heritage, immigrants who appear to have benefited frequently from the differential laws, practices, and institutions that favoured them and did nothing for the native people of Egypt.  Yet at the same time, a study of Ptolemaic Egypt reveals also a pattern of increasing assimilation between Greeks and Egyptians. Such assimilation was not solely the result of increasing mutual tolerance and respect.  Indeed, the history of Greco-Macedonian relations with the Egyptians demonstrates that whatever respect and privileges the ruling classes ultimately granted to the natives of Egypt were at least in part the result of violent Egyptian assertiveness, in the form of armed rebellion.  The history of interactions between Greeks and Egyptians in Ptolemaic Egypt offers an unmatched opportunity for the examination of the relations between rulers and ruled, of the clash between ethnic groups, and of the forces that lead to reception on the one hand and resistance on the other.",

Taking as its starting point Joseph Tainter's,  The Collapse of Complex Societies (1988), the class will look at various explanations for Rome's \"Decline & Fall\" advanced by scholars from the time of Gibbon to current applications of ecological theory to the analysis of historical events.  Relevant comparisons to other cultures which have suffered similar declines, as well as to present-day events, will be made as they arise in the chronological order of the course material.",

The focus is on using real options theory and methodology to value investments characterized by uncertainty, irreversibility, and flexibilty inthe timing of irreversible expenditures.  The course begins with an introduction to stochastic processes, Ito's Lemma, the Black-Scholes equation, contingent claims analysis and dynamic programming. Methods to solve simple option value problems will be presented, such as binomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation.  Applications will focus on problems in natural resource and environmental economics, such as valuing the option ot drill for oil or install pollution control equipment and, time permitting, other appications in economics.",

Different types of states have addressed ethnic problems in different ways: some have sought to maintain harmonious multicultural communities: others have preferred to assimilate or segregate minorities; yet others have engaged in ethnic cleansing.  We will trace the roots of nationalism and the consequences of its rise, and we will also discuss the impact of state system on the ethnic policy.",

For example, how is it that finite brain with finite experience comes to have the compelling intuition that there are infinitely many numbers?  Second, there is the question of the role of human culture in learning.  All human and non-human animals have some numerical capacities.  However, mathematical devices as simple as verbal counting or the place-value system are only ever mastered by a subset o humans, Why is that and what is it that allows some of us to master and create new numerical systems?  Third, there is the question of the structure of language.  All languages have special structures for making number, varying from the English singular-plural system, to the singular-dual-trial-plural system of some Slavic languages.  Why do all languages somehow mark number and how do children acquire these structures?  This course will be survey of theories and data that bear on all these questions, starting for Plaget and building up to contemporary work.",

It is especially important in development because most of young children's social conflicts concern the possession and use of objects and these conflicts often involve reasoning about ownership. This class will examine the development of reasoning about ownership.  Although the main approach will be developmental, a multidisciplinary approach will be taken.

For example, in explaining why someone goes to a certain store we might say the she DESIRES to buy a hammer, and BELIEVES the store sells them.  The ability to reason about beliefs, desires, and other mental states is often called \"theory of mind.\"  How this ability develops in childhood, has been grealty debated over the past 20 years, and remains mysterious (e.g. how can we learn that people have mental states when we cannot see mental states, but only infer them by observing people's behaviour).  This course will mainly concern the development of theory of mind in childhood, and we will discuss the major empirical discoveries and theorectial positions in this area of investigation.",

Although pretence is often taken for granted, and perhaps considered childish, it is mysterious: How do children pretend, and purposely represent the world as different than it really is?  And how are children able to recognize what others pretend?  Are children behaviourists about pretend play? Or does successful pretence signal that your children engage in mental state reasoning ('theory of mind')?  Theories of children's (and adults') pretence have sought to provide answers to the questions.  These theroies are still actively debated, and are the main topic of this course.

Disorders of perception and vision such as agnosias, of attention such as neglect, of language such as apshasias and dyslexias, of memory as in dementias, and amnesia, and of higher-order functions as in callosal split brain patients will be considered.  We will also examine the relationship between findings from case studies and neuroimaging of cognitive functions.

The course challenges students to explore the implications and planning opportunities under the Canadian rules and to learn how these rules interact with foreign tax law.  The course also examines how Canadian companies can make effective use of low-tax jurisdictions in international tax planning to own and to finance foreign operations.  Finally, the course explores how domestic and international developments and rules, such as transfer pricing, might impact such planning currently and in the future.",

Building on the works of early Greeks (e.g., Protagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Thucydides) and others (e.g., hermeneutic scholars, pragmatists, and contemporary social scientists) who have addressed matters of intersubjectivity and human accomplishment, the emphasis is on articulating theory that is attentive to community life in the making.  Focusing on the interlinkages of speech, objects, and activity, particular attention is given to the development of pragmatist thought within rhetoric, poetics, philosophy, history, and the social sciences.",

This controller typically consists of a linear time-invariant compensator together with a tuning mechanism which adjusts the controller gains; typical control objectives are stabilization and tracking.The bulk of the course will be centered on an identifier based approach. Here one chooses a model for the plant, whose parameters are unknown, and the plant parameters are recursively estimated; controller gains are computed assuming that the present estimate is corrent. We first study algorithms to carry out parameter estimation, we then look at various control laws, and finally these are combined to yield an adaptive controller.

This culminates in an introduction to total quality (TOM) and its three cornerstones: continuous improvement, customer focus, and total organizational involvement.  The remainder of the course examines these cornerstones in greater detail.  The objectives of the course are: (1) to develop an appreciation for importance of managing the quality at all levels, and stages of the organization, (2) to introduce techniques for defining, monitoring, and improving quality, and (3) to encourage critical thinking about issues in managing quality, within the organization, and in society in general.

This proposal includes a review of the relevant literature, the methodology,, the timeline, and a breakdown of task assignments.   Next students obtain ethics approval for their research project.  Then student teams apply the business sustainability toolbox, and their management skills to the real-world problem of their live case.  Each field study includes conducting a situation analysis, developing a sustainability strategic plan for the organization including a complete and coherent business case.  A Faculty member assists each team.  Students deliver field study project results as a report to both the organization and the course instructor.

Proposed software will include, but will not be limited to:\r\n\r\nGeoGebra:\r\nGeoGebra is an interactive geometry software package which enables geometric constructions and algebraic manipulations.  Constructions can be made with points, vectors, segments, lines, polygons, conic sections, and functions.  All elements can be changed dynamically afterwards.  GeoGebra has the ability to use numerical values or variables in designating, vectors and points.  It can be used to make conjectures and prove algebraic and geometric theorems.  Examples of this type of activity will be included. \r\n\r\nMaple:\r\nMaple is a powerful computer algebra system.  It is a general-purpose program that can be used fro most mathematical work.  There is extensive support for numerical computations, to specified precision, as well as symbolic computation and visualization.  Maple is programmable.  Custom user interfaces can also be created.  \r\n\r\nStudents will be introduced to Maple using examples that will be similar in nature and scope to those that they will expect to see in later courses.\r\n\r\nLaTeX: \r\nLaTeX is a document markup language that can be used for creating sophisticated typeset mathematical documents.  LaTeX is widely used by professional mathematicians, scientists and engineers.  More recently, LaTeX has been used as the language of online scientific communication for individuals in a variety of disciplines. \r\n\r\nLaTeX will be integrated with both Maple and GeoGebra to produce documents that include both static and dynamic mathematical diagrams. The course will also take a brief look at the history of mathematical communication and its impact on the development of the subject.",

Greek and Roman plays, both tragic and comic, changed substantially in form and subject matter as they made their way from Athens in the fifth century BCE, across the immense Hellenistic kingdoms, and into the republic of Rome in the third century BCE.  Broadly speaking, fifth century Greek tragedies and comedies strongly focused upon Athenian political events, and explicitly engaged the historical figures, and socio-political issues of their day.  In contrast, comedies written in the Hellenistic period have been interpreted as a depiction of the domestic trials of a Greek household, a situation that makes no reference to contemporary events or characters.  In short, the comedies of the Hellenistic period are bereft of political commentary.  In the second half of the course, we will consider the response of Greek drama to Macedonian domination.  In traditional historical narratives of the early Hellenistic period, Macedonian hegemony and the rise of large autocratic empires are linked to the decline of Athenian democracy and the rise of 'individualism'.  Do the late plays of Aristophanes, and the dramas of Menander and Plautus, all devoid of socio-political content, suggest a civic body that is disengaged politically? How did the Hellenistic and Roman audience receive and read the dramatic characters?  To whom, and how, were these plays speaking?  Did the plays implicitly engage civic issues, or were they merely understood as light relief from the world of resettlements, economic risks, and ever-present war?  How do the Hellenistic dramas of Menander and Plautus shape identity, if at all?",
